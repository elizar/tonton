**Initial Post**. Make sure you edit this or you can add a new post by
creating a ***markdown*** file under the `_post` dir. Make sure you follow the
naming convention as well. Also, on top of your every post there's a
meta data that gives `tonton` the information it needs to render your
post.

### For lazy folks

You can do `$ tonton post <newly-written.md> file`. Pretty slick right?
